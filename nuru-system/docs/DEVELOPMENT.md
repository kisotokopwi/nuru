## üîß Development Best Practices

### Backend
- Follow FastAPI conventions
- Use Pydantic models for validation
- Implement proper error handling
- Add comprehensive logging
- Write unit tests for critical functions

### Frontend
- Use TypeScript strictly
- Follow React hooks patterns
- Implement proper loading states
- Handle errors gracefully
- Use Material-UI components consistently

### Database
- Always use migrations for schema changes
- Add proper indexes for performance
- Implement soft deletes where appropriate
- Maintain referential integrity

### Security
- Validate all inputs
- Use parameterized queries
- Implement proper authentication
- Log security events
- Regular security audits

## üìä Architecture Decisions

### Why FastAPI?
- Modern async framework
- Automatic API documentation
- Built-in validation with Pydantic
- Excellent performance
- Easy testing

### Why React + TypeScript?
- Type safety for large applications
- Excellent ecosystem
- Material-UI for professional design
- Strong community support

### Why PostgreSQL?
- ACID compliance
- Excellent performance
- JSON support for flexible data
- Robust backup and replication

## üêõ Common Issues and Solutions

### Backend Issues
- **Database connection errors**: Check PostgreSQL service and credentials
- **Migration conflicts**: Resolve conflicts manually or reset migrations
- **Import errors**: Check Python path and virtual environment

### Frontend Issues
- **API connection errors**: Verify backend is running on correct port
- **Build errors**: Clear node_modules and reinstall dependencies
- **Authentication issues**: Check JWT token storage and expiration

### Database Issues
- **Permission errors**: Ensure database user has proper permissions
- **Connection limits**: Check PostgreSQL max_connections setting
- **Performance issues**: Add appropriate indexes and optimize queries

## üìà Performance Considerations

### Backend Optimization
- Use database indexes for frequently queried fields
- Implement pagination for large datasets
- Use async operations where possible
- Cache frequently accessed data

### Frontend Optimization
- Lazy load components and routes
- Implement virtual scrolling for large lists
- Optimize bundle size with code splitting
- Use React.memo for expensive components

### Database Optimization
- Regular VACUUM and ANALYZE operations
- Monitor slow queries
- Implement appropriate indexes
- Consider read replicas for reporting

## üß™ Testing Strategy

### Backend Testing
- Unit tests for business logic
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Database tests with test fixtures
- Authentication and authorization tests

### Frontend Testing
- Component unit tests
- Integration tests for user flows
- API integration tests
- Accessibility tests

### End-to-End Testing
- Critical user journeys
- Cross-browser testing
- Mobile device testing
- Performance testing

## üöÄ Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- Local development with hot reload
- Separate development database
- Mock external services

### Staging Environment
- Production-like environment
- Automated testing pipeline
- Performance monitoring

### Production Environment
- Containerized deployment (Docker)
- Load balancing and scaling
- Automated backups
- Monitoring and alerting
