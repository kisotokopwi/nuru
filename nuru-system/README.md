## üìã Prerequisites

Before setting up the system, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.8+**: Backend development
- **Node.js 16+**: Frontend development
- **PostgreSQL 12+**: Database server
- **Git**: Version control

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd nuru-system
```

### 2. Run the Setup Script
```bash
./scripts/setup.sh
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

#### Backend Configuration
Edit `backend/.env`:
```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://nuru_user:nuru_password@localhost:5432/nuru_db
SECRET_KEY=your-super-secret-key-change-this-in-production
COMPANY_NAME=Nuru Company
COMPANY_ADDRESS=Dar es Salaam, Tanzania
COMPANY_PHONE=+255-XXX-XXXXXX
COMPANY_EMAIL=info@nurucompany.co.tz
```

#### Frontend Configuration
The frontend environment is already configured in `frontend/.env`:
```env
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:8000/api/v1
```

### 4. Database Setup

Create the PostgreSQL database:
```bash
createdb nuru_db
```

Run database migrations:
```bash
cd backend
source venv/bin/activate
alembic upgrade head
```

### 5. Create Super Admin User
```bash
cd backend
python create_admin.py
```

Follow the prompts to create your super admin account.

### 6. Start the Application

#### Start Backend (Terminal 1)
```bash
cd backend
source venv/bin/activate
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

#### Start Frontend (Terminal 2)
```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```

### 7. Access the Application

- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:8000
- **API Documentation**: http://localhost:8000/docs

## üìä System Architecture

### Database Schema
The system uses a well-structured relational database with the following key entities:

- **Users**: System users with role-based access
- **Clients**: Client companies (GSM, etc.)
- **Projects**: Client projects
- **Sites**: Work locations under projects
- **Worker Types**: Configurable worker categories with rates
- **Daily Records**: Daily work and payment records
- **Invoices**: Dual invoice system (client & internal)
- **Audit Logs**: Complete activity tracking

### API Architecture
- RESTful API design with FastAPI
- Role-based authentication and authorization
- Comprehensive error handling
- Automatic API documentation with Swagger/OpenAPI
- Request/response validation with Pydantic

### Frontend Architecture
- Component-based React architecture
- Context API for state management
- Material-UI for consistent design
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Protected routes based on user roles

## üîê Security Features

- **JWT Authentication**: Secure token-based authentication
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Different permissions for different user roles
- **Audit Logging**: Complete activity tracking
- **Data Validation**: Input validation on both frontend and backend
- **SQL Injection Protection**: ORM-based database queries
- **CORS Configuration**: Secure cross-origin resource sharing

## üìà Key Workflows

### Daily Record Entry (Supervisor)
1. Supervisor logs in and selects their assigned site
2. Enters daily worker counts by type
3. Records actual payments made to workers
4. Adds production metrics and notes
5. System automatically locks record after the day ends

### Invoice Generation (Admin)
1. Admin reviews daily records for a site
2. System generates dual invoices simultaneously:
   - **Client Invoice**: Basic information (worker counts, production)
   - **Nuru Invoice**: Detailed information (including payment details)
3. Both invoices share the same core data to prevent fraud
4. PDFs are generated and stored for records

### Fraud Prevention
- Records cannot be modified after the day ends
- All corrections are logged with reasons
- Dual invoice system ensures consistency
- Complete audit trail for all actions

## üìã Development Guidelines

### Backend Development
- Follow FastAPI best practices
- Use Pydantic models for request/response validation
- Implement proper error handling
- Add audit logging for all important actions
- Write unit tests for critical functionality

### Frontend Development
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow Material-UI design guidelines
- Implement proper error handling and loading states
- Use React hooks and context for state management
- Ensure responsive design

### Database Management

- Follow naming conventions for tables and columns
- Implement proper foreign key relationships
- Add appropriate indexes for performance

## üß™ Testing
